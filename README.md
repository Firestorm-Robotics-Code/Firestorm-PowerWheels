# Firestorm-PowerWheels

Lawson and eventually Jakson, you should research Git Clone. I hope to, by Monday December 7th, have both of you with a dual boot system, which will make it a lot easier.

You should be able to, from the Arduino file > open menu, open the ino files (inside the directories - that part is mission critical).

Make sure that your systems have the Sparkfun SAMD boards. Go to tools > board > boards manager and search it. Install will take a while.  
You may need to do some other things - google it.

If you need to make huge and potentially program breaking changes, create a new branch.

# Support table:

|                                              | Linux             | Windows        | Mac    | ChromeOS      | Opinion |
| - | - | -------        | ---    | --------                                   | ------- |
| Arduino support | yes               | yes            | yes    | Nope                                       | Linux, Windows, and Mac all have good support, but Windows isn't as easy to install on. Not going to talk about Chromeos.
| Git support | yes               | very bad       | fair   | Nada                                       | Linux and Mac both have extremely good git support. Windows is actually beaten by Chromeos here.
| Easy access to github | yes               | yes            | yes    | Yes                                 | But Chromeos is very bad so it should count as a no.
| Ease of use for me | yes               | nope           | barely | absolutely not                             | This is an opinion row.
| Ease of use for other programmers | maybe             | yes            | fair   | Nope cubed                                 | I count as another programmer, right?
| Atom (code editor - likely unnecessary) | awesomely perfect | bad            | goodly | probably not - bordering on absolutely no. | Again, windows and mac turn flaming turd (Windows and ChromeOS) into - never mind.
| Terminal interface | Extremely good | No | Yes | Definitively not | Mac uses zsh by default, which is strange compared to Bash and is beauty itself compared to Powershell, CMD.exe, and Crosh
| Otherwise goodliness | yes               | absolutely not | ok     | Terrible by definition | Linux forever.
