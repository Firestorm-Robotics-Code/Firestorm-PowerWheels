# Firestorm-PowerWheels

Lawson and eventually Jakson, you should research Git Clone. I hope to, by Monday December 7th, have both of you with a dual boot system, which will make it a lot easier.

You should be able to, from the Arduino file > open menu, open the ino files (inside the directories - that part is mission critical).

Make sure that your systems have the Sparkfun SAMD boards. Go to tools > board > boards manager and search it. Install will take a while.  
You may need to do some other things - google it.

If you need to make huge and potentially program breaking changes, create a new branch.
